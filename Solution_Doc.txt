When I run the simulation, I find the pattern:
input  output
1         1
2 - 3     1  3
4 - 7     1  3  5  7
8 - 15    1  3  5  7  9  11  13  15
...

So my formula is:
Give an input N,
Find a power of 2 that is closest to and smaller than N. For example, if n is 15, the power of 2 is 8 (2^3).
The result = 2 * (N - 'closest power of 2') + 1 

I also build the Solution.cpp program to make this come true.
It uses a while loop to compute the 'closest power of 2'.

The whole program runs in O(log n) as the while loop will run log N iterations given an input N.
The space useage is O(1).

To compile the program, the command is as follows:
g++ -Wall Solution.cpp -o solution

To run the program, the command is as follows:
./solution
